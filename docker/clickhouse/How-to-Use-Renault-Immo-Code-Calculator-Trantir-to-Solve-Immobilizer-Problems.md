# How to Use Renault Immo Code Calculator Trantir to Solve Immobilizer Problems
 
If you have a problem with your Renault immobilizer system, such as a lost key, a desynchronized keyfob, or a damaged ECU, you may need to get the immobilizer security code to repair the system and start the vehicle. The immobilizer security code is a unique number stored in each immobilizer related part: engine control unit, immobilizer control unit, and the key. Usually, you can order this code from a Renault dealer, but this may take too much time and money.

Fortunately, there is a faster and cheaper way to solve this problem by yourself. You can use a software tool called Renault Immo Code Calculator Trantir. This tool can calculate the immobilizer security code from the label inside the ignition key or from the immobilizer EEPROM dump. It supports most Renault immobilizer systems produced in the range of year 1994-2002. It can also perform key programming, configuration, EEPROM read/write, reset to virgin, and set odometer functions for some models.
 
To use this tool, you need to have a computer with Windows operating system, an interface cable to connect your car's ECU or immobilizer unit to the computer, and a programmer device to read and write the EEPROM data. You also need to download and install the Renault Immo Code Calculator Trantir software from this link: [http://codecard.eu/immo/renault/renault-immo-code-calculator/prod\_23.html](http://codecard.eu/immo/renault/renault-immo-code-calculator/prod_23.html). The software requires a password to run, which is trantir[^3^].
 
Once you have everything ready, you can follow these steps to use the tool:
 
1. Connect your car's ECU or immobilizer unit to the computer using the interface cable.
2. Run the Renault Immo Code Calculator Trantir software and enter the password trantir.
3. Select your car model and year from the list.
4. Select the source of the security code: label inside the key or EEPROM dump.
5. If you choose label inside the key, enter the code printed on the label. If you choose EEPROM dump, read the EEPROM data using the programmer device and load it into the software.
6. Click on Calculate button and wait for the result. The software will display the immobilizer security code on the screen.
7. Write down or copy the security code and use it to repair your immobilizer system according to your car's manual or service guide.

That's it! You have successfully used Renault Immo Code Calculator Trantir to solve your immobilizer problem. You can now start your car and enjoy driving it again.
